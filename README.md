=================

##### Idea capture for racing minds / Foldable stories

<hr />

A prototype built in 24h for the [University of Alberta Computer Engineering Club's 2015 Hackathon](http://hackathon.compeclub.com/).

Eureka/Fold is a mobile-first note-taking web app. 

**Demo**: [http://eurekafold.herokuapp.com]()

On mobile: swipe right-to-left for more detail, other way for less.  
Otherwise: use shift+right for more detail, other way for less.

When you're capturing an idea, it's **Eureka**. 

When you're reading a story, it's **Fold**.
